#Two Stage Bootloader

This is a funcitioning two stage bootloader adapted from http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDev6.html
Running the run.sh file will create the flopppy image and run it with qemu. The run.sh file is commented to show how the floppy is mounted, and the second stage bootloader is written on it after which it is run.
