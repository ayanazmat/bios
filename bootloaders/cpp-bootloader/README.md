#C++ Bootloader

This bootloader has been implemented using the following link: [Writing your own Windows Bootloader](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/tips/boot-loader.aspx?fid=1541607&df=90&mpp=25&noise=3&sort=Position&view=Quick&fr=1#_Toc231383167)

This tutorial was made for windows and I haven't been able to port it to Linux yet. I will continue trying and post an update.
