#Linux 0.01 Bootloader

Here is the source for the Linux 0.01 Bootloader. 
It's interesting to look at since it is a complete bootloader that could load Linux 0.01.
I was having trouble getting all of source for 0.01 to compile due to backwards compatibiity problems. I will take a deeper look into it in the future.
